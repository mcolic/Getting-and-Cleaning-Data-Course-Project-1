# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

Introduction
================================================================
This repo is to solve the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project on Coursera.

The data is sourced from:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Script
================================================================
The run.analysis script has four parts to it.

* It reads in the text files from the data source and removes variables that irrelevant
* The train and test tables are merged with the activity and features tables
* The train and test tables are merged together
* A new data set is created (tidy_data.txt) with the merged train and test tables to calculate the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

CodeBook
================================================================
Describes the variables and steps taken to clean the data.
